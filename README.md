# scion-coord
SCIONLab Coordination service

### Setup and configuration

#### Dependencies

##### Setup go, scion, and scion-coord

Make sure that you have `go` and `python3` installed. Then, follow instructions 2 and 3 at https://github.com/netsec-ethz/scion.

Then, download this repository either by cloning it or by using `go get github.com/netsec-ethz/scion-coord`.


##### Go dependencies

The application uses govendor. You need to install govendor via:
`go get github.com/kardianos/govendor`

After this step, you can go to the `scion-coord` directory (`$GOPATH/src/github.com/netsec-ethz/scion-coord`) and populate the dependencies in the `vendor` folder using:
`govendor sync`


#### Custom configuration

Copy the default configuration file using
`cp conf/development.conf.default conf/development.conf`
and adjust the settings to fit your setup.
Make sure that you set `email.pm_server_token`, `email.pm_account_token`, `captcha.site_key`, and `captcha.secret_key` as described below.


##### Postmark

SCIONLab Coordination service uses [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/ "Postmark") to send emails. You will need an account token and a server token which are obtained by signing up to their service.
Set the corresponding fields in the configuration file accordingly.


##### Captcha

In the configuration file also populate the captcha fields with the keys generated [on this site](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin "Google ReCaptcha admin page").
For a quick start and for testing these keys can be used:

```
Site key: 6LeIxAcTAAAAAJcZVRqyHh71UMIEGNQ_MXjiZKhI
Secret key: 6LeIxAcTAAAAAGG-vFI1TnRWxMZNFuojJ4WifJWe
```
Warning: Use above keys only for testing purposes as they circumvent the captcha.


#### MySQL database

The project needs a working MySQL server instance running locally. 
Under Ubuntu, you can
install MySQL server with the following command:

`sudo apt-get install mysql-server`

Refer to the `conf/development.conf` regarding how to set your root password
for MySQL server installation. You also need to ensure that there is a
database named `scion_coord_test`. 

You can do this by first logging into your
MySQL server by
`mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p`
and then executing the following command:
`CREATE DATABASE scion_coord_test;`


#### Credentials

In order for the configurations to be generated, the following files must exist:
```
credentials/ISD1-AS1-V0.crt
credentials/as-sig.key
credentials/ISD1-V0.trc
```


### Run scion-coord

Afterwards, you can run `go run main.go` from the root folder.
Otherwise you can also run the application via:

```
go build
./scion-coord
```


### Current APIs

The APIs are defined in the `main.go` file.
Additional documentation can be found under Wiki.
