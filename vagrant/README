# SCIONLabVM
SCIONLab Virtual Machine



## How to Run

### For Ubuntu, OS X Users:

The shell script 'run.sh' will automatically check your system and install
the necessary packages to run SCIONLabVM, such as 'vagrant' and 'virtualbox'.
It will also create and configure the SCIONLabVM automatically.

Please Note: SCIONLabVM requires 'vagrant 1.9.7', 'virtualbox 5.0.4' or above.
SCIONLabVM also requires that your host machine has a public IP address and
can receive UDP traffic on port 50000.

In order to install the latest version of packages, the shell script will run
apt-get update on your system. Please make sure that all the running VMs are
suspended or closed before running the script.

If you agree with these requirements, you can then simply setup your SCIONLabVM via:
'./run.sh' from inside the downloaded folder.

Once the setup is finished, you will automatically be inside the SCIONLabVM
through SSH. After this step, you will be ready to run SCION as follows:

'cd /go/src/github.com/netsec-ethz/scion', and
'./scion.sh run'

You should then be able to see the beacons being received from SCIONLab AS 1-7.



### For Windows Users:

SCIONLabVM requires 'virtualbox' and 'vagrant'.
First, you need to download and install the 'virtualbox' from:
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

After this step, you also need to download and install 'vagrant' from:
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

Afterwards, open a terminal window and go to the SCIONLabVM folder where the
'Vagrantfile' is located. Now, you can run `vagrant up`. The command will
automatically download the base VM image storing 'ubuntu/xenial64', and
install 'SCION' with all other dependencies.

If the 'vagrant up' command returns the prompt, you are ready to have fun
with 'SCIONLabVM'.

Finally, you can run 'vagrant ssh' to connect to your VM, and then run SCION
as follows:

'cd /go/src/github.com/netsec-ethz/scion', and
'./scion.sh run'



## Stopping and Restarting the VM

You can stop and restart 'SCIONLabVM' using 'vagrant' commands.
In order to stop the VM, run 'vagrant halt' from the downloaded configuration folder.
If you want start the VM again, just run 'vagrant up'.
